[SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) is one of the most popular sets of design principles in object-oriented software development. Itâ€™s a mnemonic acronym for the following five design principles:

- [**S**ingle Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)

- [**O**pen/Closed Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle)

- [**L**iskov Substitution Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)

- [**I**nterface Segregation Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle)

- [**D**ependency Inversion Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)


This is a Java code that has different cases which show how applying SOLID principles effects code design.

For each principle, there are three files in Sources folder;

 - **Before** files: A default implementation of sample case

 - **After** files: Related Principle applied version of the case

 - **Exercise** files: Exercise for practice 

to show the difference in simple and clear way.
